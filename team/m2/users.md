# Target Users

## Organizations (workplaces, volunteer groups, clubs, etc.)

Our application will facilitate coordinating available times among groups of people, so our target user base is essentially any organization that needs to coordinate synchronous meeting times among it's personnel.

The application is centered around the creation of **events** which can be created by some users (e.g. team leaders) and accepted with input on scheduling by other users (e.g. team members).

The application will also be integrated with outside technologies, making it easier for organizations to integrate it with their work flow. Events can be downloaded or automatically exported to 3rd party calendar apps (Google Calendar), and event invites and schedules will be sent to relevant users emails.

## Niches

Our application will also cater to certain needs of specific users.

**Invitee Availability:** Our application will allow users invited to events to input their availability. This allows users to set the invite list of an event before the final time has been scheduled.

**Time Zone Support:** Our application will support coordinating availability across different time zones. This specifically targets organizations with personnel throughout different parts of the world as users.
