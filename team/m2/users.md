# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web application, **Coordin8**, include organizations such as workplaces, volunteer groups, and clubs that require easy coordination of synchronous meeting times among their personnel. Coordin8 is designed to simplify scheduling by supporting users in various time zones, streamlining the event creation process, and providing integration with external calendars like Google Calendar.

Organizations with distributed teams, particularly those operating across multiple time zones, will benefit the most from the app. **Team leaders** or **event organizers** can create events and invite others, while **team members** or **invitees** can input their availability, ensuring the most convenient time is selected for all participants.

Coordin8's seamless integration with email and calendar services allows it to fit effortlessly into the workflow of modern organizations, making it easier to manage events and schedules across different platforms.
