# Coordin8: Problem Statement
## Problem: 
While When2Meet and other calendar applications that allow people to meet work well with syncing up times, **they don't allow for people to account for varying time zones**. Variance in time zones is essential for having everyone on the same page and meeting at the same time, as 4 PM EST and PST are two different times and go differently on individuals calendars.

## Solution:
Our web application, **Coordin8**, aims to provide a more intuitive and visual solution for scheduling group meeting times. Coordin8 will allow  users to easily log their available times, view the other attendees availability, and identify a available meeting time for their event. Users will have the option to download the schedueled event to their calendar adjusted to their time zone for their calendar, whether that be Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.

- **Logging Availability**: Allows users to log their available times for the meeting on the calendar.
- **Comparing Availability**: Present real-time user availability visual so users can identify an available meeting time for their event.
- **Calendar <> Event Integration**: Users can download the appropriate calendar invite for the event to their device, allowing Coordin8 events to seamlessly show up on their device or personal use calendar. 

We will account for different EST times on the calendar. A user can select their time zone and view other user's available times in their time zone to minimize confusion. We take this one step further by providing Google Calendar and Apple Calendar events that can be added to the calendar from our event planner web application. 

## Why This Matters
In todays highly mobile world, people travel across time zones often. With the ability to sync up over the internet, people are still able to meet, yet they find themselves setting meeting times as "5 PM PST and 8 PM EST and 12 AM GMT". Coordin8 eliminates redundancies and confusion, if someone in PST says they are available at 5 PST, a user in EST will see that availability at 8 EST, the matching and correct time, making it more efficient for people to coordinate.
