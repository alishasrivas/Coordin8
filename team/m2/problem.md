# Coordin8: Problem Section
## Problem: 
While When2Meet and other calendar applications that allow people to meet work well with syncing up times, **they don't allow for people to account for varying time zones**. Variance in time zones is essential for having everyone on the same page and meeting at the same time, as 4 PM EST and PST are two different times and go differently on individuals calendars.

## Solution:
We will account for different EST times on the calendar. A user can select their time zone and view other user's available times in their time zone to minimize confusion. We take this one step further by providing Google Calendar and Apple Calendar events that can be added to the calendar from our event planner web application.
