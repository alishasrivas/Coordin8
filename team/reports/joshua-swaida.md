- **Task**: Created project/structure branch and set up project structure
- **Details**: I created a branch called project/structure. On this branch, I created a frontend folder, ran npm init, installed http-server dependency, created source folder (which contained a components, eventhub, and service folder) and created a tests folder. This all makes up the general project structure.

Added a utility folder with a fetch.js file that simulated a fetch call. Added error handling and type checking to MeetingRepositoryRemoteFakeService.js, EventHub.js, and MeetingRepositoryFactory.js.

### November 15, 2024
- **Task**: Implemented EventCreationComponent and finalized project structure
- **Details**: I created a new branch to implement my event creation feature: feature/event-creation-joshua. I implemented the UI for event creation (added all the input fields and submission buttons). I finalized the project structure by adding the index.html, main.js, and main.css files. Additionally, I started implementing the AppControllerComponent. I also created a temporary Homepage component to test the functionality of switching views (user can switch between the Homepage view and Event creation view by clicking a button).
